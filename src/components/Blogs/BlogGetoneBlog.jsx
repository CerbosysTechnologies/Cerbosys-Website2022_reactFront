          Welcome to the MDN learning area. This set of articles aims to guide
          complete beginners to web development with all that they need to start
          coding websites. The aim of this area of MDN is not to take you from
          "beginner" to "expert" but to take you from "beginner" to
          "comfortable." From there, you should be able to start making your
          way, learning from the rest of MDN, and other intermediate to advanced
          resources that assume a lot of previous knowledge. If you are a
          complete beginner, web development can be challenging â€” we will hold
          your hand and provide enough detail for you to feel comfortable and
          learn the topics properly. You should feel at home whether you are a
          student learning web development (on your own or as part of a class),
          a teacher looking for class materials, a hobbyist, or someone who just
          wants to understand more about how web technologies work.

          Complete beginner If you are a complete beginner to web development,
          we'd recommend that you start by working through our Getting started
          with the web module, which provides a practical introduction to web
          development. Beyond the basics If you have a bit of knowledge already,
          the next step is to learn HTML and CSS in detail: start with our
          Introduction to HTML module and move on to our CSS first steps module.
          Moving onto scripting If you are comfortable with HTML and CSS
          already, or you are mainly interested in coding, you'll want to move
          on to JavaScript or server-side development. Begin with our JavaScript
          first steps and Server-side first steps modules. Frameworks and
          tooling After mastering the essentials of vanilla HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript, you should learn about client-side web development tools,
          and then consider digging into client-side JavaScript frameworks, and
          server-side website programming.
